            the day, we were able to handle 1,000 requests per second in less than
            10 milliseconds and over 2,000 updates per second

            This experience sharpened my software development skills, particularly in backend development with Java
            stacks.
            I gained exposure to a broad range of technologies from React, Vue, and Angular to COBOL, Java, PHP, and
            Node.js
            providing me with a well-rounded technical perspective. It was also during this time that I developed a
            passion for software craftsmanship and agile methodologies.
            On the business side, I had the opportunity to work with clients such as SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, Mutuelle Sociale
